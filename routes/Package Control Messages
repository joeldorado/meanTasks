  Thank you for installing Less for Sublime Text.

  Less is now also in line with the scope naming guidelines for Sublime Text 3.0.

  LessImproved - Final version
  ============================
  
  This is the final release of LessImproved. The repo has been merged back into
  LESS and we'll continue supporting and improving it there.
  
  We're currently testing the new version of LESS. You can switch over now by:
  
  1.
  Add LESS to package control's prerelease list:
  
  "install_prereleases":
  [
    "LESS"
  ]
  
  2.
  Uninstall LessImproved
  
  3.
  Install LESS
  
  I hope to see everyone back at LESS and if you have questions, bugs or pull
  requests please send them here: https://github.com/danro/LESS-sublime
